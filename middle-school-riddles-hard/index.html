<p>However, jokes can help make it easier. Children need to solve different brain teaser puzzles and logic riddles based on their age and educational level. Also, you can learn the tricky riddles with answers by heart and then challenge whoever you want to solve them, at school, the park, family gatherings or wherever you want. Hard riddles can either be fun or frustrating, depending upon the difficulty of the riddle. We love all kinds of funny jokes for kids! Can you answer this one, give a try to this one, i guess.</p>
