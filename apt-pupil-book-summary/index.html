<p>Apt Pupil has two of the best characters Stephen King has ever created in my opinion. In the novella Apt Pupil by Stephen King the author illustrates and explains to us what his concept of evil is by showing us the ways society only sees and accepts the superficial aspects of people like Todd the All-American kid 111 who is acceptable in every way and although Todd seems like the American ideal that most people view as what America should. Apt Pupil is the story of Todd Bowden a brilliant kid that somehow finds out that a Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander lives nearby. But he is about to meet a different kind of teacher.
