<p>First of all I was very excited to read this book because I am a woman who before update to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-5 I would have been diagnosed with Aspergers instead of Autism Spectrum Disorder. 40 An important book full of wisdom. Rudy Simones most popular book is Aspergirls. This is good for people with an elementarymiddle school reading level. I highly recommend family friends and professionals of those who know a female with Autism read this too. Aspergirls Empowering Females With Asperger Syndrome Simone Rudy Amazon De Bucher.</p>

<p>This article is not an endorsement but a review. Aspergirls is quite atypical of many i have read and refreshing in style. This book is very much about Aspergers Syndrome and its presentation in Women and Girls. Aspergirls by Rudy Simone now apparently using the pseudonym Artemisia should by no means considered a research report nor even a research review. Being a parent of a girl with autism biases my reading interest toward books on the topic and to date I have read a lot. Qyl Illm4h6nwm.</p>
