Avoiding the Close-In Booking Fee for United Airlines Awards by Michael Last updated September 2 2015 Many US-based airlines charge a close-in booking fee whereby they charge an extra fee for booking an award ticket within 21 days of your scheduled departure. If you book an award flight with AAdvantage or MileagePlus within 21 days of departure youll be charged an additional 75 fee on top of the regular award fees and taxes increasing your out of pocket expense and often making it. Weeklyflyer We understand youve been looking for an easier way to book award travel and were happy to announce we are leading the way.

<p>For months United has proudly boasted that it is doing away with the 75 close-in processing fee for awards booked within 21 days of departure. Currently non-elites pay 75 for changes more than 21 days in advance of a flight 100 for changes within 21 days of the flight or 200 to cancel an award. If you cancel your United flight 61 or more days before departure the fee is 75 for general members 50 for Silver members 25 for Gold members and 0 for Platinum and 1K members. United is also updating their award fees. In this post I will be revealing a way to avoid the notorious close-in award booking feefor us urgent travelers.
