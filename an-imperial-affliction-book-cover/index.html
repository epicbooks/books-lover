<p>She requires Augustus to read it and in turn he requires her to read the book that is the basis of his favorite video game. Since the fake novel features the character Tulip Man were assuming thats a tulip in the window on the cover. Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years Hazel has never been anything but terminal her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. Water said the Dutchman.

<p>Its Hazel Grace Lancasters favorite book. Hazel relates to the character in her favorite book Anna because Anna has a rare blood cancer. For it was the only way to survive within me.

An Imperial Affliction is not a cancer story but its instead a story about finding yourself in this mess of a world.
