<p>Animalia is an illustrated childrens book by Graeme BaseIt was originally published in 1986 followed by a tenth anniversary edition in 1996 and a 25th anniversary edition in 2012. Each page showed a different letter of the Alphabet with animals and objects all beginning with that letter. His book The Eleventh Hour is an artistic masterpiece but unfortunately I cant really elaborate without spoiling it. What set it apart from a crowd of similar books was the incredible depth of each picture. A fantastical alliterative journey through the animal kingdom with thousands of alphabetically arranged images and ideas to discover along the way from An Armoured Armadillo through Great Green Gorillas to Zany Zebras Zigzagging in Zinc Zeppelins. Animalia The Book Wars.</p>
