<p>Interesting - thanks for letting me know Eclipse. Ayla is the heroine of Jean Auels prehistoric Earths Children series starting with The Clan of the Cave Bear in 1980 which was made into a movie in 1986 starring Daryl Hannah. Annie Sad Water Bottle I believe that Rutger is actually a name or a last name. Not knowing her name and unable to communicate with her Süleyman names her Ayla in reminiscence of the moon on the fateful night during which they met. Ayla is a total badass when it comes to hunting and healing but when interacting with other people she sometimes comes across as a bit odd or awkward due to her mannerisms picked up from the Clan in particular her tendency to be very honest which can make her seem rather blunt.
