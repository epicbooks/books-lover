<p>The year is 1988 in Gaza City and it has been a month since eleven-year-old Malaaks father left to seek work in Israel only to disappear. Age 11 and up The year is 1988 in Gaza City and it has been a month since eleven-year-old Malaaks father left to seek work in Israel only to disappear. The American author does a wonderful job of creating a portrait of a warm loving Arab family struggling to survive under siege-like conditions and the tragedy of childhood lost to religious conflicts and violence. Eleven-year-old Malaak and her family are touched by the violence in Gaza between Jews and Palestinians when first her father disappears and then her older brother is drawn to the Islamic Jihad.
