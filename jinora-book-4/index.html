<p>Jinora Book 4 vs. Jinora looks younger and more precocious because the protagonist of her series is in her early 20s. Korra is 21 in Book 4 Mako is 22 as is Asami Jinora is 14 Pema is 39 Katara is 89. Now broken and bruised Korra begins a journey of self-discovery and survival as the strong prey upon the weak. And when youre in your early 20s 12 year olds look like tiny babies. Jinora Icon Avatar Airbender Cartoon Art Styles Avatar Aang.</p>

<p>Besides being a master airbender Jinora has an avid interest in books and is a rather quiet girl in general. Now broken and bruised Korra begins a journey of self-discovery and survival as the strong prey upon the weak. And there are many supsrises that are waiting. Although shes nowhere near Jinoras level its only a matter of time before she becomes the next individual in Aangs bloodline to be dubbed an Airbending master. Both are 14 and highly talented benders. Jinora From Book 4 The Last Avatar Legend Of Korra Avatar The Last Airbender.</p>
