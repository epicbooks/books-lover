In this paper we analyse a large dataset of snapshots of the limit order book at the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd one of the worlds large electronic limit order book markets. In a symmetrical funnel plot the intercept on the X -axis should be close to zero whereas with asymmetry it may deviate considerably from zero. One approach Egger et al 1997 is to fit the points by linear regression.</p>
