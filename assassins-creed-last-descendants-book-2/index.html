<p>Access full book title Assassin S Creed 02 Last Descendents by Matthew J. If you do not know Assassins Creed is a game from Ubisoft and soon to be motion-picture. Nothing in Owens life has been right since his father died in prison accused of a crime Owen is certain he didnt commit. The story featured old Animus stuff Abstergo The multinational corporate conglomerate and the primary front for the modern day activities of the Templar Order Assassins Pieces of Eden and even our all time hero Shay Patrick Cormacs grandson. This is the first novel not counting comic with an original story and I admit I went into it with heavy hesitation.
