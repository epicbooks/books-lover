The Island of Patmos has been celebrated for almost the last 2000 years as the place where the Divine and God-inspired Book of Revelation was written by Saint John one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ. While most modern scholars think the book of Revelation was written by a Christian prophet named John and not the apostle the view that it was written by the apostle still exists.
