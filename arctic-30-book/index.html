<p>Seized at gunpoint by Russian special forces the Arctic 30 were thrust into headlines all over the world facing up to 15 years in prison and finding themselves at the center of a bitter international dispute. Unfortunately for the 30 crew members of the ship Arctic Sunrise this was not a novel and though Stewarts book reads with the heart-racing pace of a sensational action-adventure story it is a vitally true account of Greenpeace activists who were arrested in 2013 and detained for months in one of Russias most isolated prisons. The Arctic 30 as they came to be known were charged with piracy and faced the prospect of fifteen years in a Russian prison. Its written by Ben Stewart who led the global campaign to free the group. He would never call himself a hero but he is recognized on every ocean and continent for devoting his entire life to saving the planet.
