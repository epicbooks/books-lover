<p>Please accept my apologies for this mistake. Sometimes it takes years to build a strong friendship but a small argument is enough to put a strain on it. It can repair just about anything. For example I lost a book borrowed from my friend. A sincere I am sorry works like a charm. Pin On Apology Letter.</p>
