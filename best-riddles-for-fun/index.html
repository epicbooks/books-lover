<p>A riddle can also be termed as a puzzle, and it is often worded in such a way that it makes a person ponder over its solution. Riddles exercise the brain and help develop different and more flexible ways of thinking. When grant was 8, his brother was half his age. We hope you have found some old favorites, tested your brain with some really difficult riddles, and laughed a great deal, either alone or with friends. The best man always has me first. What am I? Fixing you.</p>
