If you feel you have to add on stuff that you dont really need or remove quality work to fit a certain word count it will take away from the quality of the book. Heres the general rule for any book published traditionally or self pubbed. While there is no minimum or maximum length for self-publishing on Amazon I personally recommend at least 10000 words for non-fiction. 17 Best Books On Writing To Level Up Your Creative Fiction Writing Skills Inspirational Books To Read Book Writing Tips Writing Tips.</p>

<p>You want 50000 to 85000 words for a full-length self-help book half that for a self-published eBook. Standard length self-help books grew to being 300-400 words on average. If you go to the self-help section of a bookstore it is apparent that is a pretty wide range. When it comes to writing a self-help book its easy to cross the line into memoir writing.

<p>Call it a book and you risk offending nearly 200 nations. But the way I see it especially if you intend to self-publish make it as long as you want. And dont forget to calculate what your word count will be. While theres plenty of room for variety the average chapter length for a book is between 2000 and 5000 words with the sweet spot lying between 3000 and 4000 words. But that can change.
