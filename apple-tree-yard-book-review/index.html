<p>Apple Tree Yard 2017. Although I didnt feel much of a bond with it or with Carmichael in. Sitting in a courtroom after being charged with murder a geneticist and happily married mother of two reflects on her affair with a secret lover who claimed a connection to the British government and who seduced her with an irresistible combination of sexual power justice and revenge. Apple Tree Yard 2017. I have no idea about this series or the book it was adapted from prior watching thisI just picked up it randomly as it is just 4-episode long and labeled as thrillerThis year I already got a surprise in the form of Cardinal which I have no idea just like this one but Loved it after watching.
