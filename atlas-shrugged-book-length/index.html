While written many decades ago this work of fiction has proven to be prophetic regarding many aspects of the world today. This is surprisingly because it is a horrendous book containing cardboard characters over necessarily long speeches absurd plot lines and at least 500 pages more than it needs. Spending that much time on a book is a question for individual readers. Atlas Shrugged is a novel both tremen-dous in its scope and breathtaking in its sus-pense.</p>
