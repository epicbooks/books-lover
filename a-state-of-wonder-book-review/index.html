<p>State of Wonder starts with the death of Anders Eckman a Research Doctor for pharmaceutical company Vogel. State of Wonder is heavy with literary parallels to Henry James to Greek myth but in this respect the strongest links are to Heart of Darkness a novel that Patchett substantially rewrites. But unlike The Magicians Assistant this book had in common the one fault that I found in her previous four books I have read by this truly gifted and wonderful writer and that fault lies in the ending.
