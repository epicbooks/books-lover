Average Novelist Salary With a 10 percent royalty an author who writes a book that costs 10 and sells 20000 copies makes 20000. So if your book sells for 20 you earn just over a buck. So if 100 fiction writers earned a total of 100000 then the average income is 1000. Pin On Best Of Create Wp Website Blog.</p>

<p>Easy readers have similar compensation packages but royalties are not split on novels. The results showed a clear drop in average author income from 18013 in 2006 to 10497 in 2018. Answer 1 of 2. So if 100 fiction writers earned a total of 100000 then the average income is 1000. The average writer in my experience probably makes less than 100 a year in ebook sales.

<p>But here are a few things that make a difference for authors who make thousands or more per month. When I started I earned 5-7K per year. In reality most books sell fewer than 5000 copies. If each book costs 100 then the author of a monograph might get 3000. As the authors sales increase however self-published income catches up and overtakes royalty income.
