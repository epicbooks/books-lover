<p>In this book Joram describes his personal and theological journey and the development he has undergone. During the process of writing however he found an increasing number of matters that challenged his views of Islam. There are a couple of passages however that inadvertently contradict Muslim belief and do not behoove the lofty status of Sayyiduna RasÅ«lAllÄh ï·º. Specifically atheists and researchers on Atheism cannot afford to pass on the book. It is a challenge thrust into their hands to which a personal though really an internal response is due.
