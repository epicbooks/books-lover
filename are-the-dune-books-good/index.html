<p>They are alot more action packed. Dune won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965 and the 1966 Hugo Award. Its considered required reading for science-fiction fans and the book was a huge influence on Star Wars among other sci-fi classics. Dune is a must for any sci-fi fan just to be competent in the genre. It gains from being part of the Dune series and loses by being compared with two great books.

<p>In my humble opinion - no. Messiah is a useful conclusion. The Dun book which was originally published as two serials in Analog magazine many of Herberts other Dune books were also published as magazine serials at first went on to tie with Robert. Sequals come along due to the success of the first. Ad Über 7 Millionen englischsprachige Bücher.
