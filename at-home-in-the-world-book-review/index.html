The book is narrated in the first person with the narrator changing in each chapterBobby and Jonathan are the main narrators but several chapters are narrated by Alice Jonathans mother and Clare. The characters are vividly alive. I am so glad finally to get this book off my hands That Sen has serious misgivings about the direction India is taking under Narendra Modi is well known.
