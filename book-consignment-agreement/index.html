<p>The Consignor agrees to deliver the Product to the Consignee for sale on consignment. Most stores will charge a handling fee and require a contract before accepting a book into their consignment program. There are tons of these online. Up to three 3 copies per book will be considered for the initial consignment period. Bookish charges a one-time non-refundable stocking fee of 1500 per title due at the beginning of the consignment period.
