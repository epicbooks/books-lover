Perecs novel has been translated into a few languages including English. However their formal form 8-k submission 14 indicated that they did not believe the breach would have a material impact on its financial results. However Ernest Vincent Wright would no doubt scoff as he challenged himself to pen an entire 50000 word novel without once using the letter e Whats more he somehow managed to pull it off.</p>
