<p><strong>Aron Ralston Book Review</strong>, I gave this book a four-star rating as it was extremely well written and was very emotional in places.

In fact so disdainful was Ralston of even the most basic of safety precautions explained The New York Times that a book reviewer accused him of having a death wish In addition to having gotten caught in an avalanche hed also disturbed a bear and nearly drowned among other bad choices.</p>
