<p>I thouroughly enjoyed the previous books in the series Wings and then Spells but this book is unarguably the best yet in the series. Laurels life is the very definition of normal until the morning when she wakes up to discover a flower blooming from her back. Wildalso published as Illusions is third in the Laurel series by Aprilynne Pike. Wings is the first of a series and the first book of Pikes that I read. Especially since long awaited book four is coming out this year. Wings Book Series By Aprilynne Pike A New Kind Of Faerie Tale Little Shop Of Horrors Vintage Book Covers Book Cover.</p>
